			<h2> Project 1 idea</h2>
			<h4> Thoughts</h4>
			<p>My first project will continue to develop my webwork.</p>
<p>We are all now greatly affected by the Coronavirus, which has gradually evolved from one region to a worldwide issue. Under this circumstance,
Many emotions have been communicated, and some things that seem unrelated are connected as well.</p>

<p>During this period I saw a lot of different records, by photograph or text, and many subtle feelings became traceable.</p>

<p>Desolation and tranquility coexist at this moment, I have no religious beliefs, but feel empathy and touched.Even people with no riligious beliefs is expecting salvation, for themselves and for those who are in pain.</p>

	<p>I like the simple interaction between text and images, and the visual expression of text. Therefore I want to continue to improve my webwork, add pictures, and then use simple text to highlight the theme of the pictures to make them a whole.</p>
